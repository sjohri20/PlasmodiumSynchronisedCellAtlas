# Synchronised Plasmodium Cell Atlas

This repository contains analysis code for studying the effect of temperature stress on the life cycle of *Plasmodium falciparum*. We also used the Malaria Cell Atlas to map the development stages , and found one distinct state that was present only in the temperature-stress induced cells.
